# Console Communication Tool

A simple console-based application with two roles: **Presenter** and **Listener**. The Presenter sends text input, and all connected Listeners receive it in real-time. Designed for learning and experimenting with inter-process communication in C# using .NET.

## Features

-   **Presenter**: A single instance that sends messages.
-   **Listener**: Multiple instances that receive Presenter’s messages.
-   Runs in separate console windows.
-   Real-time message broadcasting.
-   Clean folder structure and modular components.
-   Learning-focused design with extensibility in mind.
